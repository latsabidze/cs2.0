    <h2>
      Counter-Strike is an objective-based, multiplayer tactical first-person
      shooter. Two opposing teams—the Terrorists and the Counter
      Terrorists—compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing
      a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages. At
      the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual
      performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful weapons in
      subsequent rounds. Winning rounds results in more money than losing and
      completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses.
      Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, result in a penalty.
